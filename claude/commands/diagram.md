In a markdown file in a format "diagram.name.md", generate the architecture, the algorithm, the data and function flow diagrams.
Come up with a shortname yourself. If an existing file exist, update it if appropriate, otherwise, may need to name it differently. 
Use Mermaid diagram.
Do NOT use UMl style diagram.
