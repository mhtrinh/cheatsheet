# Delegated trust model
Advantage compare to Direct trust model (ssh with authorized_keys): scalability. 
- To allow new user to the mqtt server, the CA authority can generate new keys and give to new clients, while there are no change needed from the mqtt server side. 
- In comparison with ssh, each new client addition require adding a public key to the server. Making change on server is not scalable/desirable.
